    Installation

  %h2 Deploying

  %p
    BigTuna comes with a <code>config/deploy.rb.sample</code> file to use it with Capistrano.
    It should help you maintain your BigTuna installation and update it without any issues.

  %p
    The file itself is a standard Capistrano deploy file but it adds few tasks to ensure your BigTuna
    works out of the box after redeploying.

    :coderay
      #!ruby
        after "deploy:finalize_update", "deploy:symlink_configs"
        before "deploy:restart", "deploy:bootstrap"

  %p
    <code>deploy:symlink_configs</code> task updates your config files and the shared build directory
    which BigTuna will use to keep its builds.
  %p
    <code>deploy:bootstrap</code> migrates the database and restarts the delayed job runner so that it works with the latest codebase

%section
  %h2 Setting up BigTuna with Nginx and Passenger

  We assume you have your Nginx instance set up, what you need now is a server entry.

  :coderay
    #!python
      server {
        listen 80;
        server_name bigtuna.your.domain;
        root /big_tuna/root/public;
        passenger_enabled on;
      }

  After youâ€™re done, read the <a href="configuration.html">configuration section</a>.
